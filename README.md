# ProjectTorque Language files
This is an open Git for the translation of the game Project Torque.

The game supported many languages original but after around 2010, support was dropped for everything but English. 

We would like to add support for many more languages but we need support from the community to do this.

Do not simply shove this file into Google Translate and expect it to work, it wont.
There are around 50,000 lines of text to be translated. 

The official language for the game is English (GB).
Translation to English Simplified (US) will be required. 

There are currently requests for German, Hungarian, Spanish, French, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese
